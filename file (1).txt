Javascript Frameworks-Assignment 1

JavaScript is a versatile and widely used programming language that is primarily known for its role in web development.
It allows developers to create dynamic and interactive content on the client side of web applications.

Usage and Applications
Client-Side Web Development: JavaScript is predominantly used for enhancing the interactivity and functionality of web pages.
Server-Side Development: With the advent of Node.js, JavaScript can now be used for server-side development as well.
Cross-Platform Development: JavaScript can be used to build applications for various platforms, including web, mobile, and desktop

ECMAScript Versions
ECMAScript 6 (ES6) and Beyond: Introduced significant enhancements to the language, such as arrow functions, template literals,
classes, and more. Subsequent versions have continued to bring new features.

Modern JavaScript (ES6+)
Arrow Functions: A concise syntax for writing functions.
Let and Const: Block-scoped variable declarations.
Template Literals: A convenient way to concatenate strings.
Classes: Simplifies the creation of constructor functions and prototypes.
Promises and Async/Await: For handling asynchronous operations more effectively.
